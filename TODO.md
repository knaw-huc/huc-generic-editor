# REACT VERSION of the HuC Editor

Work through te list of 15-11-2019

definitely
- put some time in controlled vs uncontrolled components form
- must convert it to a form, problem React does not permit nested forms (file upload), to discuss with RZ

definitely, in order of importance
- ~~map languages multilingual~~
- ~~defined attribute list on certain fields~~
- ~~free to fill attributes on certain fields~~

- interactivity: duplicate components
- interactivity: form validation
- fill in default values

maybe, less priority now
- save a form?
- refactor Content component in smaller components
- make it all more generic
- styling the form exactly the same as the original
