# HuC-generic-editor

TypeScript / React editor for structured data

## Prerequisites

* Docker is up and running
* node.js is installed
* a *nix based system

##  Docker & TypeScript version

From the README.md directory:

 ```docker-compose up```

A lightweight PHP server is started for serving the json-configuration files. 

Visit http://localhost:8888/  in your browser. 
You see a structured form, on-the-fly generated by TypeScript

* On http://localhost:8888/ the TypeScript version
* On http://localhost:8888/server.php the json-response of the PHP server


A lightweight PHP server is started for serving the json-configuration files. 
You can edit the configuration file in:
```webroot/json_examples/devdata.json```
 
## React (alpha)

- Navigate to: ```webroot/reacteditor/```
- install the node dependencies with ```npm install```

Start the reactversion ```npm start```

Visit: ```http://localhost:3000/```
for a React version

## Without Docker and Node

You can still see what it looks like:

Open  ```webroot/standalone_original/index.html``` in your favourite browser.
The json configuration is embedded in a JS object literal.

#### Experimental
Works only after the install of the node dependencies.
Use:
```./launch.sh```
for starting the php-container for php and the react app.

## Legacy

In the main directory there are two directories, js and css with old but important versions of the HuC editor.
Both directories and  are strictly used for the application:

[Tweak Your CMDI Forms to the Max] (https://github.com/knaw-huc/clariah-cmdi-forms)

In a later stage, this will be refactored or solved in another way.

## TS Development with Visual Studio Code

- install Extension: Live Server (only once)
- From HuC editor: docker-compose up, you'll need the php server to load/server the configuration files
- From the Menu: Terminal => Run Build Task...  select tsc: Watch
- select webroot/index.html in editor
- start LiveServer (click on GoLive), you'll be redirected to: http://127.0.0.1:5500/webroot/index.html
- Every save in webroot/src/ccfparser.ts will be compiled to ccfparser.js in the same directory
- AND the LiveServer will refresh the page
